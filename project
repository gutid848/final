    <h3>New York City subway stations need an update. Walls are crumbling tile-by-tile, graffiti tags line the pillars, and leaky ceilings give commuters an unwanted indoor rainshower. Brooklyn commuter <b>Caroline Willis</b> says we should look to Stockholm as an example for design improvements. Many of the stations in the Swedish metropolis are slickly-designed and well-maintained, perhaps a reflection of the care put into the city itself. We spoke with Caroline about her thoughts on the NYC subway station design, and how Stockholm has got theirs nailed down.</h3>

<h4>Danielle Gutierrez: Do you have a commute?</h4>

<p>Caroline Willis: Yes, I commute on the L from the Jefferson Street stop in Bushwick. Coming to school, I spend about 30 minutes on the train and then I work in SoHo, so it takes me about 45 minutes to get to work both ways. So I usually spend quite a bit of time commuting on the the train as most people do in the city. And as also most people in the city have noticed: the subways are kind of decrepit and they need to be fixed. It seems like you would want to keep a standard for all of your stations. Not that it really helps anyone while commuting, but because it does make your commute more pleasant when you're in a nice environment. If they kept up with it, it would be a positive influence on those commuting.</p>

<h4>So if you were commuting in Stockholm, you think you would have a better time emotionally?</h4>

<p>Yes, I would have a much better time emotionally! The tiles need replacing. It indicates this sloppiness — if the tiling isn't up to par, then you really start wondering about the signals. To me, the tiling is an indicator of something larger.</p>

<h4>Do you think that's a lack of care for New York City infrastructure or an isolated lack of care for the subway?</h4>

<p>From articles I've read in the past, funds keep on being diverted from the MTA, so it just falls farther into disrepair and no one can really find the funds to fix it. And also, political agenda probably being swayed towards other issues. It's something that practically every New York City resident uses, it seems like that would be a priority, but I suppose not.</p>

<h4>Back to the tiling: do you like that general design scheme, the aesthetic of —</h4>

<p>No.</p>

<h4>Okay, no.</h4>

<p>For someone who's not a native New Yorker, when I first came to the city, it was very confusing compared to other subway systems that I've used in the past. I've been to London a few times and their subway stations, they kind of have it nailed down. They've figured it out. You would think that since New York City is such a prominent destination, that they would have figured that out. Even the signage on the support poles as you're coming to a station, to me, isn't quite evident enough. Especially if the train's really crowded you can't see where you are.</p>

<h4>It's just an "M." Is that Morgan or Montrose?</h4>

<p>Yeah, if the person who's operating the train, their voice is muffled, you can't see because there's so many people. You're like, "I'm gonna miss my stop. I can't see where I am."</p>

<h4>New York really prides itself on the look of those tiles, though.</h4>

<p>I was thinking about that the other day actually: How could you change the tiling — replace it and update it — while also keeping the original character of the subway? You don't have to keep the original tiles from the '30's! You can update it. You can get, "tile craftsmen" to come in and make the same logo. To keep that same look and feel: totally cool, but just update is kind of the important thing here.</p>

<h4>What is it you like about the Stockholm subway?</h4>

<p>The Stockholm subway stations — not all of them are updated, but primarily the new stations have removed all of the tile and ornamental detail. On the ceilings, there's all the original rock of when they mined the tunnel underneath the city. It seems pretty logical to keep the rock characteristic. It wouldn't experience as much wear and tear. Rock is a more durable feature than a subway tile. You achieve a different atmosphere having that cave-type feeling. It seems like the city cares about the infrastructure, and they care about the cleanliness of their stations and the experience of their commuters. They actually value them, whereas in New York it's kind of just like, "alright, get to work and just deal with it."</p>

<h4>That seems like the general mood of New York City.</h4>

<p>True.</p>

<h4>I went to the Stockholm airport and it looks like IKEA.</h4>

<p>Yeah, I think also the subway's a reflection of the culture and the public policy of that area to a certain extent. I think lack of care is the primary issue in New York. Coming from a design standpoint, elected officials exist to make their constituents happy and to help them have a better life and it seems like part of that would be by updating the design of the subway. And doing a little bit of cleaning would be nice — removing excess graffiti, all that type of stuff — and in general just a more pleasant experience. Visually it's something you stare at for at least an hour during your day as you sit there going from station to station. You could be reading a book or listening to music or whatever, but ultimately that's where you are.</p>

<h4>I was looking a pictures of the Stockholm subway stations, and the platforms even look wider.</h4>

<p>Right. New York did go through that huge effort in the '70's to clean up the subways.</p>

<h4>And the city.</h4>

<p>Yeah, to make it more safe and clean up graffiti and all of that that dominated the subways. But that can't stop. Once you fix a problem you can't just stop, you have to continuously fix the problem and continuously update the design — especially since New York is considered a center of the world and so many people come here and visit. If you're continuously updating ideas and people, you also need to continuously update where those people inhabit.</p>
